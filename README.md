# COVID19MEX-2021
Inisghts into Mexico's COVID-19 pandemics
During my master's program in Mexico, I worked on an in-depth data analysis project about COVID-19 in the country during 2021. It was a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I'm eager to share my findings with you.

In this project, I traced the evolution of the pandemic, delved into key trends, and examined the impact of various factors on COVID-19 outcomes in Mexico. From understanding the influence of age and comorbidities, the insights I uncovered are truly eye-opening.
